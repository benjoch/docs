Sports Index is a content aggregation platform that gives athletes, teams, leagues, creators, media companies, and fans a single place to organize and showcase sports content from across the internet.

Instead of scattering your best work across Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and dozens of other platforms, Sports Index pulls everything together into one shareable page.

## Key Concepts

### Portfolio Page

Your portfolio is your personal page on Sports Index. It lives at `sportsindex.app/portfolio/your-username` and serves as your home base. You control what appears here -- import content from any platform, arrange it however you like, and share a single link with the world.

### Topic Page

Topic pages are public pages built around an athlete, team, or league. They automatically aggregate all content related to that subject, making it easy for anyone to find highlights, news, stats, and more in one place.

### Collection

A collection is a custom visual layout you build using the drag-and-drop block editor. With 23 different block types -- including headings, images, embedded posts, stats charts, athlete bios, and more -- you can create anything from a simple highlight reel to a detailed scouting report.

### Timeline

The timeline is a chronological feed of content. Think of it as a living record of everything that has been published or imported, displayed in order so you can scroll through the latest updates.

### Library

The library is your searchable, filterable grid of all imported content. Every URL you bring into Sports Index lands here, and you can search, sort, and filter to find exactly what you need.
