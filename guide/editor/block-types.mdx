The collection editor includes 23 block types spread across 7 categories. Each block snaps to the 3-column grid and can be styled, resized, and edited inline by double-clicking.

<Callout type="note">
  Column span indicates how wide a block can be. A "1-col" block fits in a single column, while a "3-col" block stretches across the full canvas width. Some blocks support multiple widths -- you can resize them to fit your layout.

## Editing Blocks

Every block supports double-click to edit. What you see depends on the block type:

- **Text-based blocks** (heading, text box, rich text, pull quote) open an inline text editor with formatting controls.
- **Form-based blocks** (athlete header, athlete bio, roster, stats blocks) open a popup form where you fill in structured data.
- **Media blocks** (image, post, post gallery, embed) open a picker or URL input to select content.

## Styling Blocks

All blocks support four visual styles via the Format menu:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Container">
    The default style. Frosted glass background with subtle borders. Works for most block types.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Transparent">
    No background or border. Content sits directly on the canvas. Best for headings, dividers, and article headers.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Outline">
    A thin border with no fill. A lighter alternative to container.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Card">
    Solid card background with rounded corners and a slight shadow. Good for featured content.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
