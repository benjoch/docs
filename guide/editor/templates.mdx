Templates give you a head start when building a collection. Instead of placing every block from scratch, you can pick a pre-built layout and customize it to fit your needs.

## Choosing a Template

When you create a new collection at [sportsindex.io/collections/new](https://sportsindex.io/collections/new), the first thing you see is the template picker.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Browse the template gallery">
    The template picker shows a grid of available layouts. Each template includes a preview so you can see what the finished page looks like before committing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pick a template or start blank">
    Click any template to load it into the editor with all its blocks pre-arranged. If you prefer to build from scratch, select **Blank** to open an empty canvas.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize everything">
    Once the template loads, every block is fully editable. Move blocks around, delete ones you do not need, add new ones from the sidebar, and update all the placeholder content with your own.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Available Template Types

Templates are designed around common use cases in sports content:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Athlete Profile" icon="user">
    A full athlete page with a header, bio, stats section, and media highlights. Great for scouting reports or player spotlights.

## Customizing a Template

After loading a template, you have full control over every element:

- **Move blocks** -- Click and drag any block to reposition it on the grid.
- **Delete blocks** -- Select a block and press Delete or use **Edit > Delete** to remove it.
- **Add blocks** -- Open the sidebar and drag in any of the 23 block types to fill gaps or extend the layout.
- **Edit content** -- Double-click any block to replace the placeholder text, images, or data with your own.
- **Change styles** -- Use the **Format** menu to switch a block between container, transparent, outline, and card styles.
- **Resize** -- Drag the bottom edge of any block to adjust its height.

<Callout type="tip">
  Templates are just a starting point. Do not feel locked in -- you can rearrange, add, or remove anything. The goal is to save you time, not limit your creativity.

## Saving Your Own Templates

If you have built a layout you want to reuse, you can save it as a personal template:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build your layout">
    Arrange your blocks and content exactly how you want the template to look.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save as template">
    Go to **File > Save as Template** and give it a name. Your template will be saved to your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reuse it later">
    The next time you create a collection, your saved template will appear in the template picker alongside the built-in options.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="note">
  Saved templates include block positions, sizes, and styles, but not the actual content inside the blocks. This way, you get the layout structure without carrying over old data.
