The collection editor is where you build visual layouts for your portfolio or topic page. Think of it like a design tool -- drag blocks onto a canvas, arrange them into columns, and publish a polished page without writing any code.

## Opening the Editor

There are two ways to get started:

- **New collection** -- Go to [sportsindex.app/collections/new](https://sportsindex.app/collections/new) to start from scratch or pick a template.
- **Edit existing** -- Open any collection you own and click **Edit** to jump back into the editor.

## The Editor Interface

The editor is split into a few key areas:

### Canvas

The canvas is the main working area in the center of the screen. It uses a **3-column grid** (1336px wide) where you place and arrange blocks. Blocks snap to columns automatically, so everything stays aligned without fiddling with pixel positions.

- Blocks can span **1, 2, or 3 columns** depending on the type.
- Drag blocks to reposition them on the canvas.
- Resize blocks vertically by dragging the bottom edge.

### Sidebar

The sidebar on the left lists all available block types, organized into categories:

- **General** -- Headings, text boxes, dividers, and spacers
- **Athlete** -- Athlete headers and bios
- **Content** -- News blocks
- **Article** -- Article headers, rich text, and pull quotes
- **Media** -- Images, embedded posts, post galleries, and generic embeds
- **Stats & Data** -- Charts, tables, head-to-head comparisons, and more
- **Team** -- Roster blocks

Click or drag any block from the sidebar to add it to your canvas.

### Toolbar

The toolbar along the top gives you access to the main menus:

| Menu       | What it does                                                                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **File**   | Save, publish, preview, and manage your collection                           |
| **Edit**   | Undo, redo, duplicate, and delete blocks                                     |
| **Insert** | Quick access to add any block type without scrolling the sidebar             |
| **Format** | Change block styles -- container, transparent, outline, or card              |

## Working with Blocks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a block">
    Click a block type in the sidebar or use Insert from the toolbar. The block appears on your canvas, snapped to the grid.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Position the block">
    Click and drag the block to move it to a new position. The grid will guide it into place.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the content">
    Double-click any block to edit its content inline. Depending on the block type, you will see a text editor, a form, or a media picker.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resize if needed">
    Hover over the bottom edge of a block until you see the resize handle, then drag up or down to adjust the height.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Block Styles

Every block can be displayed in one of four visual styles:

- **Container** (default) -- Frosted glass background with subtle borders. Works well for most content.
- **Transparent** -- No background or border. The block content sits directly on the canvas. Great for headings and dividers.
- **Outline** -- A thin border with no background fill. Useful for lighter layouts.
- **Card** -- A solid card-style background with rounded corners and a slight shadow.

To change a block's style, select the block and use the **Format** menu in the toolbar.

## Saving and Publishing

<Callout type="tip">
  Your work is not lost if you navigate away -- the editor auto-saves a draft. But it is still a good habit to save manually with **File > Save** when you reach a good stopping point.
</Callout>

When you are ready to share your collection:

1. Click **File > Publish** to make it live.
2. Your collection will appear on your portfolio or topic page immediately.
3. You can continue editing a published collection at any time -- just save again when you are done.
