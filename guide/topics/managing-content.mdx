As the admin of a topic page, you have a full set of tools for adding content, controlling what visitors see first, and keeping your page organized. This guide covers everything you need to know about managing content on your topic page.

<Callout type="note">
  Content management tools are only available to the verified admin of a topic page. See [Claiming a Topic Page](/guide/topics/claiming) if you have not claimed yours yet.

## Adding Content

There are several ways to add content to your topic page:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Import by URL">
    Paste any URL -- a YouTube video, tweet, Instagram post, news article, Substack post, or anything else -- and Sports Index will automatically import it. The platform, title, thumbnail, and author are pulled in for you.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open your topic page">
        Navigate to your topic page and make sure you are logged in.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Click Add Content">
        Use the **Add Content** button in the admin toolbar.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Paste the URL">
        Enter the URL of the content you want to add. Sports Index supports content from Twitter/X, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, ESPN, Substack, and many other platforms.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review and save">
        Check that the imported details look correct, then save. The content will appear in your timeline and library.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Upload media">
    You can upload images and other media files directly. Click **Add Content**, select **Upload**, and choose a file from your device.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Community contributions">
    Content submitted by fans through the Community tab can be featured on your main timeline. See [Community Contributions](/guide/topics/community) for details.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setting a Featured Image

The featured image is the banner that appears at the top of your topic page. A strong featured image makes a great first impression.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open page settings">
    Click the settings icon in your admin toolbar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload or choose an image">
    Upload a new image or select one from your library. For best results, use a high-resolution image with a wide aspect ratio.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your changes">
    Click save and the new featured image will appear at the top of your topic page immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  Action shots, team photos, and branded graphics all make great featured images. Aim for at least 1200 pixels wide for a crisp look on all devices.

## Organizing Your Timeline

The timeline is the chronological feed that visitors see when they land on your topic page. As admin, you can control what appears and how it is prioritized.

### Pinning Content

Pin your most important content to the top of the timeline so it is the first thing visitors see. This is useful for announcements, signature highlights, or key news stories.

### Hiding Content

If something shows up on your timeline that you do not want featured -- maybe it is outdated, irrelevant, or low quality -- you can hide it. Hidden content is removed from the timeline view but stays in your library in case you want to restore it later.

### Featuring Community Submissions

Great content from fans can be promoted from the Community tab to your main timeline. This rewards contributors and ensures the best content gets seen by everyone.

## Organizing Your Library

The library is the searchable grid of all content associated with your topic page. Visitors can filter and search the library to find specific content.

As admin, you can:

- **Tag content** to make it easier to find through filters
- **Remove content** that should not be associated with your page
- **Sort and prioritize** so the most relevant content surfaces first

## Removing Content

If content does not belong on your topic page, you can remove it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the content">
    Locate the content in your timeline, library, or community tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the content menu">
    Click the menu icon (three dots) on the content card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Remove">
    Choose **Remove** from the menu. The content will be removed from your topic page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Removing content from your topic page does not delete the original source. It simply unlinks it from your page. If the content was submitted by a community member, they will not be notified of the removal.
