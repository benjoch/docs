Custom tabs let you extend your topic page beyond the built-in Timeline and Library views. Each tab is a fully customizable layout built using the collection editor, so you can design exactly the experience you want for your visitors.

<Callout type="note">
  Custom tabs are only available to verified admins of a topic page. If you have not claimed your page yet, see [Claiming a Topic Page](/guide/topics/claiming) first.

## What Are Custom Tabs?

Every topic page comes with a **Timeline** and a **Library** tab by default. Custom tabs are additional tabs that you create and design yourself. You can add as many as you need, name them whatever you want, and arrange them in any order.

Each custom tab is powered by the **collection editor** -- the same drag-and-drop block editor used to build collections elsewhere on Sports Index. That means you have access to all 23 block types, including headings, images, embedded posts, stat charts, athlete bios, pull quotes, and more.

## Creating a Custom Tab

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your topic page settings">
    Navigate to your topic page and open the admin toolbar. Click **Manage Tabs** (or the equivalent option in your settings).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a new tab">
    Click **Add Tab** and give it a name. Choose something descriptive -- visitors will see this name in the tab bar at the top of your page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design your layout">
    The collection editor opens with a blank canvas. Start adding blocks by clicking the block types in the sidebar. Drag and drop blocks to arrange them, resize them, and fill in your content.

    <Callout type="tip">
      The editor uses a 3-column grid system. Blocks can span one, two, or all three columns, giving you flexible layout options. Double-click any block to edit its content.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and publish">
    When you are happy with your layout, save the tab. It will immediately appear on your topic page for all visitors to see.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Your Tabs

### Reordering Tabs

You can change the order that tabs appear in the tab bar. Open **Manage Tabs** from your admin toolbar and drag tabs into your preferred order. The first tab in the list is what visitors see by default when they land on your page.

### Renaming Tabs

To rename a tab, open **Manage Tabs**, click the tab name, and type a new one. Changes are reflected immediately.

### Editing Tab Content

To update the content of a tab, click on the tab and then click **Edit** in the admin toolbar. This opens the collection editor where you can add, remove, or rearrange blocks.

### Deleting a Tab

If you no longer need a tab, open **Manage Tabs** and click the delete option next to the tab you want to remove.

<Callout type="warning">
  Deleting a tab removes all of its content permanently. This cannot be undone, so make sure you no longer need the content before deleting.
