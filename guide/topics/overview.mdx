Topic pages are public pages on Sports Index built around a specific sports subject -- an athlete, team, league, tournament, or anything else in the world of sports. They automatically aggregate all content related to that subject into one place, making it easy for fans and followers to find everything they are looking for.

Every topic page lives at `sportsindex.app/topic/{name}` and is visible to anyone, no account required.

## What Makes Topic Pages Special

<Cards>
  <Card title="Automatic Aggregation" icon="layer-group">
    Content about a topic is pulled together from all users and platforms. If someone posts a highlight, writes an article, or shares stats about a subject, it can appear on that topic page.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Community-Powered" icon="users">
    Fans, journalists, and creators all contribute content. The topic page becomes the definitive hub for everything related to that subject.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Claimable" icon="shield-check">
    Athletes, teams, and leagues can claim their topic page to become the official admin -- adding custom tabs, managing featured content, and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Discoverable" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Topic pages are categorized by sport, league, and level, so anyone can find them by browsing the Explore page at `sportsindex.app/explore`.

## What Visitors See

When someone visits a topic page, they get a complete picture of that subject:

- **Featured image** -- a banner image chosen by the admin (or a default if unclaimed)
- **Timeline** -- a chronological feed of all content related to the topic, from the latest news to throwback highlights
- **Library** -- a searchable, filterable grid of every piece of content that has been tagged to the topic
- **Custom tabs** -- if the page has been claimed, the admin can add tabs like Home, Stats, Highlights, Sponsors, and more using the collection editor
- **Community tab** -- a space where fans can contribute and share content

## Topic Pages vs. Portfolios

It is easy to mix these up, so here is the key difference:

| | Topic Page | Portfolio |
|---|---|---|
| **About** | A subject (athlete, team, league) | A person's work and content |
| **URL** | `/topic/{name}` | `/portfolio/{username}` |
| **Content source** | Aggregated from all users | Added by the account owner |
| **Who controls it** | The verified admin (or unclaimed) | The account owner |
| **Purpose** | Be the definitive page for a sports subject | Showcase an individual's content |

<Callout type="tip">
  If you are an athlete and you claim your topic page, your portfolio can automatically redirect to your topic page. That way, anyone visiting your profile ends up on the more complete, community-powered page. See [Claiming a Topic Page](/guide/topics/claiming) for details.

## Discovering Topic Pages

All topic pages are organized on the **Explore** page at [sportsindex.app/explore](https://sportsindex.app/explore). You can browse by:

- **Sport** -- pickleball, basketball, soccer, and more
- **League** -- PPA, MLP, NBA, Premier League, etc.
