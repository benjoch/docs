Claiming a topic page makes you the official admin of that page on Sports Index. Whether you are an athlete, a team manager, or a league organizer, claiming gives you full control over how your page looks and what content is featured.

## Why Claim Your Page?

An unclaimed topic page still aggregates content, but it runs on autopilot. Once you claim it, you unlock a full set of admin tools:

- **Set a featured image** to give your page a professional look
- **Create custom tabs** like Home, Stats, Highlights, or Sponsors using the collection editor
- **Curate your timeline** by choosing what content is featured or hidden
- **Manage community contributions** and decide what fans can add
- **Add datasets** for stats, results, and other structured data
- **Control your brand** with accent colors and layout choices

## How to Claim a Topic Page

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your topic page">
    Search for yourself (or your team/league) on Sports Index, or navigate directly to `sportsindex.io/topic/{name}`. If a topic page does not exist yet, you can request one to be created.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Claim This Page">
    On the topic page, you will see a **Claim This Page** button. Click it to start the process.

    <Callout type="note">
      You need a Sports Index account to claim a page. If you do not have one yet, you will be prompted to sign up first.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify your identity">
    To prevent unauthorized claims, Sports Index requires verification. Depending on the type of page, this may involve confirming your identity through an email address, social media account, or organization credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get approved">
    Once your claim is reviewed and approved, you will receive a confirmation and gain full admin access to the topic page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Only one account can be the verified admin of a topic page at a time. If someone has already claimed the page, you will see that it is verified rather than seeing a claim button.
</Callout>

## What Changes After Claiming

Once you are the verified admin, your topic page gets several upgrades:

<Accordion title="Admin toolbar">
  A toolbar appears at the top of your topic page (visible only to you) with quick access to add content, edit tabs, change settings, and manage community contributions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Custom tabs">
  You can add as many custom tabs as you need. Each tab is built using the collection editor, so you can design rich layouts with headings, images, embedded posts, stat charts, and more. See [Custom Tabs](/guide/topics/custom-tabs) for a full walkthrough.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Featured content controls">
  Pin important content to the top of your timeline, hide posts you do not want featured, and organize your library however you like.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Community moderation">
  Control what fans are allowed to contribute and review submissions before they appear on your page. See [Community Contributions](/guide/topics/community) for details.
</Accordion>

## Portfolio Redirect

If you are an athlete and your topic page is your primary page, you can have your portfolio automatically redirect to your topic page.

When your account has a **primary topic** set and your claim is verified, anyone who visits `sportsindex.io/portfolio/your-username` will be seamlessly redirected to your topic page at `sportsindex.io/topic/{name}`.

<Callout type="tip">
  This is great for keeping a single link in your social media bios. Whether someone visits your portfolio URL or your topic URL, they end up in the same place.
</Callout>
