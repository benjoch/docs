description: "Let fans contribute content to your topic page"
---

One of the most powerful features of topic pages is community contributions. Fans, journalists, and creators can all add content to a topic page, helping build the most complete picture of any athlete, team, or league.

## How the Community Tab Works

Every topic page has a **Community** tab where fan-submitted content lives. When someone finds a great highlight, article, or interview related to your topic, they can submit it directly to your page.

<Callout type="note">
  Contributors need a Sports Index account to submit content. Their submissions are attributed to their username.

### For Fans and Contributors

Contributing content to a topic page is straightforward:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit the topic page">
    Navigate to the topic page you want to contribute to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to the Community tab">
    Click the **Community** tab in the tab bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit content">
    Click **Add Content** and paste the URL of the content you want to share. Sports Index will automatically pull in the title, thumbnail, and platform information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your content appears">
    Depending on the admin's moderation settings, your submission may appear immediately or after review.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### For Admins

As the verified admin of a topic page, you have full control over community contributions:

<Accordion title="Review submissions">
  When moderation is enabled, new submissions land in a review queue. You can approve, reject, or ignore each one. Approved content appears on the Community tab; rejected content is removed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Feature community content">
  Found a great fan submission? You can feature it on your main timeline or pin it to the top of the Community tab so it gets the visibility it deserves.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Remove content">
  If something does not belong on your page, you can remove it at any time -- whether it was auto-approved or manually approved earlier.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Set moderation preferences">
  Choose whether community submissions appear automatically or require your approval first. If your page gets a high volume of contributions, moderation helps you keep quality high.
</Accordion>

## Moderation Controls

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Auto-Approve">
    All community submissions appear on the Community tab immediately. You can still remove content after the fact. This works well for smaller communities or when you want to encourage maximum participation.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual Review">
    Every submission goes into a review queue. Nothing appears publicly until you approve it. This gives you full control but requires more active management.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="tip">
  If you are just getting started, try auto-approve to encourage early contributions. You can always switch to manual review later as your community grows.
</Callout>

## Engagement Tools Coming Soon

We are actively building more ways for communities to interact with topic pages. Here is what is on the roadmap:

- **Reactions** -- let fans react to content with likes and other quick responses
- **Discussion threads** -- enable conversations around specific pieces of content
- **Contributor leaderboards** -- highlight the most active and helpful community members
- **Notifications** -- get notified when new content is submitted to your page

<Callout type="note">
  These features are in development and will roll out over time. Follow us on social media or check back for updates.
