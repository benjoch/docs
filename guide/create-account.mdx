There are two ways to get started on Sports Index: signing up for a new account or claiming a page that has already been created for you.

## Sign Up for a New Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the signup page">
    Visit [sportsindex.io](https://sportsindex.io) and click **Sign Up**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your email">
    Provide a valid email address. You will need to verify it before your account is fully active.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a username">
    Your username becomes part of your portfolio URL (`sportsindex.io/portfolio/your-username`), so pick something recognizable.

    <Callout type="note">
      Usernames must be between 3 and 30 characters. You can use letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set a password">
    Create a strong password for your account.

    <Callout type="warning">
      Your password must be at least 8 characters and include an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and a number.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify your email">
    Check your inbox for a verification email from Sports Index and click the link inside. Once verified, you are all set.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Claim a Pre-Created Account

In some cases, a Sports Index page may already exist for you -- for example, if your team or league has set one up on your behalf. Claiming it is straightforward.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your claim link">
    You will receive a claim link via email or from whoever created the page. Click the link to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your email and password">
    Enter the email address you want associated with your account and choose a password (same requirements as above: 8+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Land on your portfolio">
    After claiming, you will be redirected straight to your portfolio page. Everything that was already added to your page is waiting for you.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  Once you have claimed your account, you have full control. You can add new content, rearrange your portfolio, and update your profile at any time.
