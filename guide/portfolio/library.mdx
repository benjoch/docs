Your library is the central place where every piece of content you have imported lives. It gives both you and your visitors powerful tools to browse, search, and filter everything in your portfolio.

## Viewing modes

Your library supports two ways to browse content. Switch between them using the toggle at the top of the library tab.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Grid view">
    Grid view displays your content as a **masonry layout** of visual cards. Each card shows the thumbnail, title, platform icon, and publish date. This view works well when your content is visually rich -- videos, images, and articles with strong thumbnails.

    Items flow naturally into the available space, so the layout adapts to different screen sizes without wasted gaps.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Table view">
    Table view displays your content as a structured list with columns for title, platform, date, topics, and type. This view is ideal for quickly scanning a large library or finding a specific item by name or date.

    You can sort any column by clicking its header.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Filtering your content

As your library grows, filters help you zero in on exactly what you are looking for. The filter bar appears at the top of the library and supports the following options:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Platform" icon="browser">
    Show only content from a specific source -- X, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, ESPN, Substack, Spotify, or Reddit.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Topic" icon="tag">
    Filter by topic tags like player names, team names, or sports. Topics are assigned when you import content or added manually.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Type" icon="layer-group">
    Narrow by content type, such as videos, articles, or social posts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Date" icon="calendar">
    Filter by date range to find content from a specific time period.
  </Card>
</Cards>

Filters can be combined. For example, you could show only YouTube videos tagged with a specific player name from the last six months.

## Sorting

Control the order of your library items with the sort menu:

- **Date** -- newest or oldest first (based on when the content was originally published)
- **Name** -- alphabetical by title

In table view, you can also click column headers to sort by that column.

## Search

Use the search bar to find items by title or keyword. Search works across all content in your library regardless of any active filters, so you can always find what you need quickly.

## Managing topics on items

Topics keep your library organized and power the filtering system. You can manage topics on any item:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open an item">
    Click on any item in your library to open its detail view.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit topics">
    Add new topics or remove existing ones. Topics are freeform text, so you can create whatever categories make sense for your content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Your changes take effect immediately and update the topic filter options for your library.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  Consistent topic naming goes a long way. Decide on a convention early -- for example, always using full player names rather than nicknames -- so your filters stay clean as your library grows.
