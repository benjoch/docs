Timelines let you arrange content in chronological order to tell a story that unfolds over time. Whether you are tracking a player's career arc, a team's season, or a developing news story, timelines give your content a narrative structure that a flat library cannot.

## What is a timeline?

A timeline is an ordered sequence of content items displayed along a vertical chronological axis. Each item shows its date, thumbnail, title, and platform, making it easy for visitors to follow the progression of events.

Every portfolio comes with a built-in **Timeline tab** that automatically shows all your imported content in chronological order. But you can also create **custom timelines** that focus on a specific theme or story.

## Creating a custom timeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a new timeline">
    Navigate to [sportsindex.app/timelines/new](https://sportsindex.app/timelines/new) or click the **New Timeline** button from your portfolio.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Give it a name">
    Choose a clear, descriptive title. This is what appears as the tab name on your portfolio and in shared links.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add posts">
    Select content from your library to include in the timeline. Items are arranged automatically by their publish date.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and publish">
    Preview the timeline to make sure the story flows well, then publish it to make it visible on your portfolio.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Navigating timelines

Timelines include a **year and month navigation legend** along the side, allowing visitors to jump quickly to a specific period. This is especially useful for long timelines that span months or years of content.

  The navigation legend updates dynamically based on the content in your timeline. Months with no content are skipped, so visitors always land on something relevant.

## What makes a good timeline

Timelines work best when they have a clear theme. Here are some ideas:

- **Player career highlights** -- track a player's journey from draft day through key moments.
- **Season recap** -- collect the best moments, articles, and analysis from a full season.
- **Breaking story** -- follow a trade rumor, injury update, or playoff race as it develops.
- **Personal coverage** -- if you are a journalist, curate your own reporting on a topic in the order it was published.

## Sharing timelines

Custom timelines get their own shareable URL that you can send to anyone. Visitors do not need a Sports Index account to view a timeline -- it is fully public.

Timelines also appear as tabs on your portfolio page, so anyone browsing your profile can discover them alongside your main timeline and library.

<Callout type="note">
  You can create as many custom timelines as you like. Each one appears as a separate tab on your portfolio.
