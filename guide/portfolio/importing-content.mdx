The fastest way to build your portfolio is to import content you have already published or collected elsewhere. Sports Index makes this simple -- just paste a link and we handle the rest.

## How importing works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the import page">
    Navigate to [sportsindex.app/create](https://sportsindex.app/create) or click the **Add Content** button from your portfolio.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste a URL">
    Drop in a link from any supported platform. Sports Index reads the page and pulls in the relevant metadata automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and save">
    Check the extracted title, thumbnail, and details. Add any tags or topics you want, then save the item to your library.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported platforms

Sports Index can import content from a wide range of sources:

| Platform | Content types |
|---|---|
| **X (Twitter)** | Tweets, threads, video posts |
| **YouTube** | Videos, shorts |
| **Instagram** | Posts, reels |
| **TikTok** | Videos |
| **ESPN** | Articles, scores, highlights |
| **Substack** | Articles, newsletters |
| **Spotify** | Podcast episodes |
| **Reddit** | Posts, threads |

<Callout type="tip">
  If a platform is not listed above, you can still paste the URL. Sports Index will attempt to extract metadata from any public web page using its generic link resolver.
</Callout>

## What gets extracted

When you paste a link, Sports Index automatically pulls in as much information as it can:

- **Title** -- the headline or post text
- **Thumbnail** -- a preview image from the content
- **Author** -- who published or posted it
- **Platform** -- where the content lives (Twitter, YouTube, etc.)
- **Publish date** -- when the content was originally posted

You can edit any of these fields before saving if something does not look right.

## Bulk importing

If you have a lot of content to add, you do not have to paste links one at a time. The import page supports bulk importing -- paste multiple URLs (one per line) and Sports Index will process each one in sequence.

<Callout type="note">
  Bulk imports process each URL individually, so each item can be reviewed and tagged before saving. For very large imports, this may take a moment.
</Callout>

## Auto-tagging with topics

Sports Index analyzes your imported content and suggests relevant topics automatically. Topics are tags like player names, team names, sports, or themes that help organize your library and make content easier to find.

You can:

- Accept the suggested topics as-is
- Remove topics that do not fit
- Add your own custom topics

Topics power the filtering system in your library, so taking a moment to tag content well pays off when your collection grows.
