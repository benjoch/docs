Your profile settings control how your portfolio looks to visitors. A well-crafted profile makes a strong first impression and helps people understand who you are and what content you curate.

## Accessing your settings

Navigate to [sportsindex.io/portfolio/settings](https://sportsindex.io/portfolio/settings) or click the settings icon on your portfolio page. You must be signed in to edit your profile.

## Profile fields

<Accordion title="Avatar">
  Your profile photo appears on your portfolio page and anywhere your name shows up on Sports Index.

  | Requirement | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Max file size | 5 MB |
  | Supported formats | JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP |
  | Recommended size | Square image, at least 400x400px |

  <Callout type="tip">
    Use a clear headshot or recognizable logo. Avoid images with busy backgrounds -- they tend to look cluttered at small sizes.
  </Callout>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Banner image">
  The banner stretches across the top of your portfolio and sets the visual tone for your entire page.

  | Requirement | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Recommended dimensions | 1400 x 400 px |
  | Max file size | 5 MB |
  | Supported formats | JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP |

  <Callout type="note">
    The banner is displayed at a wide aspect ratio. Images that are too tall will be cropped from the center. For best results, use a landscape-oriented image and keep important details toward the center of the frame.
  </Callout>

  **Tips for a great banner:**
  - Stadium or court photos work well and immediately signal a sports focus.
  - Keep text minimal -- it may get cut off on smaller screens.
  - High-contrast images look better against the dark theme of the platform.
  - Avoid very bright or all-white images, as they can clash with the site design.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Bio">
  A short description that appears below your name on your portfolio page.

  | Requirement | Detail |
  |---|---|
  | Max length | 500 characters |

  Use your bio to tell visitors what kind of content you curate, which sports or teams you focus on, and what makes your perspective unique. Keep it concise -- a sentence or two is often enough.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Social links">
  Connect your other profiles so visitors can find you across platforms. Sports Index supports links to the following:

  - **X (Twitter)**
  - **Instagram**
  - **YouTube**
  - **TikTok**
  - **Substack**

  Each link appears as a recognizable icon on your portfolio page. Just paste the full URL to your profile on each platform.

  <Callout type="tip">
    You do not need to fill in every social link. Only add the platforms where you are actively posting -- empty links are hidden automatically.
  </Callout>
</Accordion>

## Saving changes

After editing any field, save your changes using the button at the bottom of the settings page. Updates appear on your portfolio immediately -- there is no delay or review process.

<Callout type="warning">
  Banner and avatar uploads are permanent once saved. If you want to revert, you will need to upload the previous image again.
