Collections are the most flexible way to present content on Sports Index. Unlike timelines, which follow a strict chronological order, collections let you build fully custom visual layouts using a drag-and-drop block editor.

## What is a collection?

A collection is a custom page made up of **blocks** -- individual content elements that you arrange on a canvas. Blocks can be text, images, embedded posts, charts, stats, and more. You have full control over the layout, so each collection can look completely different.

Think of collections as mini-pages within your portfolio. Some examples:

- **Player profiles** with stats, bio, photos, and embedded highlights
- **Game recaps** mixing your commentary with embedded tweets and video
- **Best-of lists** showcasing your top picks with images and descriptions
- **Visual stories** that blend text, media, and data in a magazine-style layout

## Creating a collection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a new collection">
    Navigate to [sportsindex.io/collections/new](https://sportsindex.io/collections/new) or click the **New Collection** button from your portfolio.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your collection">
    Give it a title that describes the content or theme. This appears as the tab name on your portfolio.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build your layout">
    Use the block editor to add and arrange content blocks on the canvas. Drag blocks to reposition them, resize to fit your layout, and double-click to edit content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish">
    When your layout looks the way you want, publish the collection to make it live on your portfolio.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The block editor at a glance

The collection editor uses a **three-column grid system** with a sidebar of available block types. Here is a quick overview of what you can work with:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="General blocks">
    - **Heading** -- section titles and headers

    - **Divider** -- horizontal lines to separate sections
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Media blocks">
    - **Image** -- upload or link photos and graphics
    - **Post** -- embed a single post from any supported platform
    - **Post gallery** -- display multiple embedded posts together
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Content blocks">
    - **Article header** -- styled headers for longform content
    - **Rich text** -- formatted text with full editing controls
    - **Pull quote** -- highlighted quotes that stand out visually

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Stats and data blocks">

    - **Data table** -- structured data in rows and columns
    - **Bar chart** -- visualize comparisons

## Publishing and sharing

Once you are happy with your collection:

- **Publish** it to make it visible as a tab on your portfolio page.
- Each collection gets its own **shareable URL** that anyone can view, even without a Sports Index account.
- You can **unpublish** a collection at any time to hide it from your portfolio while you make edits, then republish when it is ready.

<Callout type="tip">
  Collections are a great way to go beyond simple content curation. Use them to build rich, visual pages that show off your editorial voice and design sensibility.
