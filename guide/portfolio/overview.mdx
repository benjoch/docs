A portfolio page is your personal hub on Sports Index -- a single place to organize and showcase sports content you have collected from across the internet.

## What is a portfolio page?

Think of it as a profile page built specifically for sports content. Instead of scattering your favorite highlights, articles, and analysis across bookmarks and social media saves, your portfolio brings everything together in one shareable link.

Your portfolio lives at a clean URL like:

```
https://sportsindex.io/portfolio/your-username
```

## What visitors see

When someone visits your portfolio, they will find:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Banner and avatar">
    A large banner image across the top with your profile photo overlaid, giving your page a polished, personal feel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bio and social links">
    A short bio that tells visitors who you are, along with links to your profiles on X, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Substack.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Content tabs">
    Tabbed navigation that lets visitors explore your content in different ways -- your timeline, library, custom timelines, and collections.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Built-in tabs

Every portfolio comes with two tabs out of the box:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Timeline" icon="clock">
    A chronological feed of everything you have imported, displayed newest-first. Visitors can scroll through your content history at a glance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Library" icon="grid-2">
    A browsable grid (or table) of all your content with filters for platform, topic, type, and date. Great for visitors who want to find something specific.
  </Card>
</Cards>

Beyond these defaults, you can create **custom timelines** and **collections** that appear as additional tabs on your portfolio. These let you curate and arrange content around specific themes, players, or stories.

## Who should use a portfolio?

Portfolios are designed for anyone who collects and shares sports content:

- **Sports journalists and writers** who want a living portfolio of their published work across multiple outlets.
- **Content creators** who produce highlights, analysis, or commentary across platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and X.
- **Fans and enthusiasts** who curate the best content around their favorite teams, players, or sports.
- **Coaches and scouts** who compile video breakdowns, stats, and scouting reports.
- **Athletes** who want a single page showcasing media coverage, interviews, and highlight reels.

No matter how you use it, a portfolio gives your content a permanent, organized home that you control.
