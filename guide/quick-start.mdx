This guide walks you through setting up your Sports Index portfolio and importing your first piece of content. The whole process takes about five minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Head to [sportsindex.app](https://sportsindex.app) and sign up with your email, a username, and a password. Need help? See the full [Create Your Account](/guide/create-account) guide.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import your first piece of content">
    Go to [sportsindex.app/create](https://sportsindex.app/create) and paste a URL into the import field. Sports Index will automatically pull in the title, thumbnail, and metadata.

    <Callout type="tip">
      You can import content from a wide range of platforms, including Twitter/X, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, ESPN, Substack, and many more. If a URL is publicly accessible, there is a good chance Sports Index can handle it.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Visit your portfolio">
    Navigate to `sportsindex.app/portfolio/your-username` to see your page. Your imported content will appear here automatically. As you add more content, your portfolio grows with it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share your link">
    Copy your portfolio URL and share it anywhere -- in your social media bios, on your website, in emails, or wherever your audience can find it. Anyone with the link can view your page, no account required.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What to do next

Now that your portfolio is live, here are a few ways to make it your own:
