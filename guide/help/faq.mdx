<Accordion title="What is Sports Index?">
  Sports Index is a content aggregation platform that gives everyone in sports -- athletes, teams, leagues, creators, media companies, and fans -- a professional, customizable page. Import content from any platform, organize it by topic, and share one link instead of scattered profiles across the internet.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the difference between a Portfolio Page and a Topic Page?">
  A **Portfolio Page** is your personal page. It lives at `sportsindex.app/portfolio/your-username` and is where you organize and showcase your own content -- highlights, articles, videos, and anything else you have imported.

  A **Topic Page** is a public page built around a sports subject like an athlete, team, or league. It aggregates content from all sources and can accept community contributions. Anyone can browse topic pages, and the subjects themselves can claim their page to become the official admin.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What platforms can I import content from?">
  You can import content from YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, X/Twitter, Substack, ESPN, Spotify, Reddit, and many more. Just paste a link and Sports Index will automatically pull in the title, thumbnail, and metadata. If the platform is not directly supported, Sports Index falls back to reading the page's Open Graph metadata to create a link card.

  See the full list on the [Supported Platforms](/guide/help/supported-platforms) page.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does claiming a Topic Page work?">
  Any athlete, team, or league can claim their topic page to become the official admin. Once claimed, you control what appears on the page, manage custom tabs, and get categorized for discovery across Sports Index. To start the claiming process, visit the topic page and click **Claim This Page**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Sports Index free?">
  Yes. Portfolio Pages are free forever and include unlimited imports, a built-in timeline, and a searchable library. You can build collections, organize content, and share your page without paying anything.

  Paid plans unlock additional features like custom tabs, branding, and automated content ingestion. Topic Pages start at $25/month for organizations that want to manage a public page for their athlete, team, or league.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the free tier limits?">
  The free Portfolio Page includes:
  - Unlimited content imports
  - A chronological timeline
  - A searchable, filterable library
  - The full collection editor with all 23 block types
  - A shareable portfolio URL

  Paid plans add features like custom branding, automated ingestion, custom tabs, and priority support.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I switch plans later?">
  Yes. You can upgrade or downgrade at any time. If you are on a free Portfolio Page, you can upgrade to Creator whenever you are ready. Topic Page plans can be changed by contacting us.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What does automated content ingestion include?">
  On supported plans, Sports Index automatically pulls your new content from YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and X/Twitter on a weekly basis. New posts are categorized and added to your page without any manual work. You do not need to paste individual URLs -- just connect your accounts and let it run.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I import content in bulk?">
  Yes. You can paste multiple URLs at once on the import page at `sportsindex.app/create`. Each URL is processed individually, and the results appear in your library as they finish.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is a Collection?">
  A collection is a custom visual layout you build using the drag-and-drop block editor. With 23 different block types -- headings, images, embedded posts, stats charts, athlete bios, and more -- you can create anything from a simple highlight reel to a detailed scouting report. Collections are pinned to your portfolio or topic page for visitors to browse.

  Learn more in the [Collection Editor overview](/guide/editor/overview).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do visitors need an account to view my page?">
  No. Portfolio pages, topic pages, and collections are all publicly accessible. Anyone with the link can view your content without signing up.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I get help or report an issue?">
  You can reach us on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/sportsindexapp) or by emailing support. We are a small team and respond quickly.
